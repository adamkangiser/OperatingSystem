# OperatingSystem
Simulates an operating system handling processes.

We are building a microcosm of the internals of an operating system (some of them) in order to beter
understand, to illuminate the interplay of algorithms, and to learn. We will look at classic ideas about
CPU time management and how that affects performance. Java language is used.
